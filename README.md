# Project 1: Sales Dashboard: Profit, costs, Revenues.

* Created a dashboard to visualize the revenues, profits and costs of a sales department using Power Bi.

**You will be able to see:**
* A sales report with a columm chart to visualize the total revenues per month, and boxes showing the total revenue and the quantity saled.
* A cost report with the costs per month in a columm chart, and fixed boxes with total costs, total inventory cost, total production cost, total transport cost.
* A profit report with the profit per month in a columm chart, and fixed boxes showing total revenue, total costs, total profit and profit margin.
* In the next 3 pages you will be able to see these KPI's per product.
